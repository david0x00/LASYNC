# LASYNC
This project was part of my work at the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems laboratory.  The Goal of the project was to be able to capture data about the movement of an object on the ocean floor.  This python code controls a laser trip wire system that I designed and also captures data during the experiment.  The system uses and Raspberry Pi and 3 phototransistors.
